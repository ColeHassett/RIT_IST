Plugins:
Jquery UI is used for many sections including majors, minors, and resources
bigSlide is used for the navigation side bar
Sticky is used for the nav button you see on the side of the page no matter where you are
Vex is used for all the dialog pop ups including the tables, people, and research

I believe my site is formatted very well and uses plugins to make the site feel right. The flow of the site makes sense and is user friendly, and the nav
makes it easy for the user to jump to any part of the site instantly. The site is extremely interactive so the user gets to click on many things, which keeps
them aware of where they are on the page. Overall, the site is very clean and user friendly.
